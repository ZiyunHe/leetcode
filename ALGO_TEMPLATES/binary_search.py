"""
* Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible elements;
* Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;
* Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
